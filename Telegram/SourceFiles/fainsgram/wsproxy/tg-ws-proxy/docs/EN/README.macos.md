## Building from Source

Detailed instructions: [BuildFromSource.md](./BuildFromSource.md)

The interface requires Tk, CustomTkinter, and access to Cocoa via PyObjC. They are installed automatically, except for Tk, which must be included in your Python build.

```bash
pip install -e .
tg-ws-proxy-tray-macos
```
